                <p> In the heart of our design philosophy lies the belief that there is beauty
                    in imperfection. At TD2Stacks Interiors, we celebrate the wabi-sabi approach to
                    interior design, finding elegance in the asymmetry, richness in the simplicity,
                    and profound grace in the patina of time. Our spaces are more than just visually
                    appealing; they are a testament to the uniqueness of life itself, where every
                    imperfection tells a story. Let us help you discover the imperfect beauty that
                    makes your space authentically yours.</p>

            <span>About Us</span>
            <p>Director and Head Designer: Tshimangadzo Denzhe Ramathuba (23 years-old) is
                 a qualified senior interior designer, and a qualified junior architectural
                technologist. He completed his studies at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology
                (CPUT) during the years of 2019 up until 2022. 
                As he was pursuing his diploma in architectural technology, he soon began to realize 
                that he has more of a gift and passion for interior design.
                <br> Despite him having that epiphany, he decided to first complete his diploma in 
                
                architecture because he understood its importance and that he’d have somewhat of an 
                advantage when it came time to make that transition. During his third year (2021) he
                applied for the advanced diploma program in interior design, and 2022 was by far his
                best year in varsity. He had evolved as a designer in a such a short space of time.<br>
                Although he had struggled in the first half of that year, the work that he had produced
                in his second semester was the complete opposite, it was as if he did not miss the 
                first three years of undergrad in interior design.
                He is also currently pursuing a career in the film industry; he is currently an intern
                at Film Afrika. He will be taking what he learnt in architecture and interior design, 
                and he’ll be applying that in film. He aspires to become an art director one day, as 
                well as set designer, and in the long a production designer.
